    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chole Bhature is a popular and hearty North Indian dish, especially loved in the Punjab region and Delhi. It consists of spicy and flavorful chickpea curry (Chole) served alongside deep-fried, fluffy bread (Bhature) made from maida (all-purpose flour). It is often enjoyed for breakfast or lunch, but can be a fulfilling meal any time of the day</p>
    <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hearty and Filling:</strong>Chole Bhature is a substantial meal due to the combination of rich chickpea curry and fried bread.</li>
            <li><strong>Spicy and Tangy Flavors:</strong>The chole are typically flavored with a blend of spices, onion, tomato, ginger, garlic, and sometimes incorporate ingredients like dried pomegranate seeds (anardana) or amla for a tangy element.</li>
            <li><strong>Fluffy and Crispy Bhature:</strong>The bhature are deep-fried, resulting in a bread that is crispy on the outside and soft and airy inside.</li>
            <li><strong>Served with Accompaniments:</strong>Chole Bhature is often accompanied by pickled onions, green chutney, and sometimes a glass of cooling Lassi or Masala Aloo. </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Basic steps to prepare</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Chole</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Soak Chickpeas:</strong>Wash and soak the chickpeas overnight or for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Boil Chickpeas:</strong>In a pressure cooker, combine the soaked chickpeas, water, salt, whole spices (like black cardamom, cloves, and bay leaves), and optionally a tea bag for color. Pressure cook until the chickpeas are soft and tender. Discard the whole spices and tea bag.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Gravy:</strong>Heat oil in a pan or kadai. Saut√© chopped onions and ginger-garlic paste until the onions are translucent. Add chopped tomatoes, salt, and cook until they soften and the oil begins to separate.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Spices:</strong>Incorporate a blend of spices like coriander powder, chana masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and optionally dried pomegranate powder (anardana) or amla powder. Cook the spices for a minute or two until fragrant.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine and Simmer:</strong>Add the boiled chickpeas (along with some of the reserved cooking water) to the gravy. Mix well, cover, and simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Adjust salt and add garam masala to finish.</li>
            <li><strong>Garnish:</strong>Garnish with fresh cilantro. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Bhature</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>Sift together all-purpose flour (maida), baking powder, and baking soda. Combine with yogurt, salt, sugar, and water, kneading into a soft dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest the Dough:</strong>Lightly oil the dough, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest for at least 30 minutes, or longer for better results.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll and Fry:</strong>Divide the dough into balls and roll each ball into an oval or round shape, as thin as possible without tearing. Heat oil in a kadai or wok for deep-frying. Drop the flattened dough into the hot oil. It should puff up almost immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook and Serve:</strong>Fry until both sides are golden brown. Remove from oil and place on paper towels to drain excess oil. Serve hot with the prepared Chole. </li>
        </ol>
