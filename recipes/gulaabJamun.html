    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gulab Jamun is a classic Indian dessert, beloved for its soft, spongy texture and fragrant syrup. These small, round balls are typically made from Khoya (reduced milk solids) or milk powder, says Yummy Tummy Aarthi. They are deep-fried until golden brown and then steeped in a warm sugar syrup infused with aromatic spices like cardamom, rose water, and sometimes saffron. The name itself, derived from the Persian words "gul" (flower) and "ƒÅb" (water), reflects the rosewater-scented syrup, while "jamun" refers to the Indian blackberry, a nod to the dessert's shape and color. </p>

    <h2>Basic steps to prepare</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Dough: </strong>Combine Khoya or milk powder, flour, and a pinch of baking soda (and optionally cardamom) and gently knead into a soft dough. Be careful not to over-knead, which can make the jamuns tough.</li>
            <li><strong>Shape the Balls:</strong>Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into smooth, crack-free balls.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Syrup:</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Fry the Jamuns:</strong> Boil sugar and water until the syrup becomes slightly sticky (it should not reach a one-string consistency). Infuse with cardamom, rose water, and optionally saffron. Keep the syrup warm.</li>
            <li><strong>Soak in Syrup:</strong>Drain the fried jamuns and immerse them in the warm sugar syrup. Allow them to soak for at least 30 minutes, or preferably for a few hours, to absorb the syrup.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>Garnish with chopped pistachios or your desired toppings and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
