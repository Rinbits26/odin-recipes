    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Shahi Paneer is a creamy Indian curry made with paneer (Indian cottage cheese) cooked in a rich gravy of cream, tomatoes, onions, cashews and a blend of aromatic spices. The word "Shahi" means royal, highlighting the dish's rich taste and association with regal cuisine, originating in the Mughal era.
